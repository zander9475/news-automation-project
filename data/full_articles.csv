Intel’s Stock Tumbles After Trump Says Its CEO Must Resign,,"Shares of Intel slumped Thursday after President Donald Trump said in a social media post that the chipmaker’s CEO needs to resign.

“The CEO of Intel is highly CONFLICTED and must resign, immediately,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “There is no other solution to this problem. Thank you for your attention to this problem!”

Trump made the post after Sen. Tom Cotton sent a letter to Intel Chairman Frank Yeary expressing concern over CEO Lip-Bu Tan’s investments and ties to semiconductor firms that are reportedly linked to the Chinese Communist Party and the People’s Liberation Army, and asked the board whether Tan had divested his interests in these companies to eliminate any conflicts of interest.

It’s not immediately clear if Tan, who took over as Intel’s CEO in March, has divested his interests in the companies.

In a statement, Intel said it’s “deeply committed to advancing U.S. national and economic security interests and are making significant investments aligned with the President’s America First agenda.”

“In March 2025, Intel appointed Lip-Bu Tan as its new CEO,” Cotton wrote in the letter. “Mr. Tan reportedly controls dozens of Chinese companies and has a stake in hundreds of Chinese advanced-manufacturing and chip firms. At least eight of these companies reportedly have ties to the Chinese People’s Liberation Army.”

Cotton specifically called out Tan’s recent leadership of Cadence Design Systems in the letter. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, Cadence, in July, agreed to plead guilty to resolve charges that it violated export controls rules to sell hardware and software to China’s National University of Defense Technology, which is linked to the Chinese military. Tan was the CEO of Cadence when the company violated the rules between 2015 and 2021.

The U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security also fined Candence $95 million for the same breaches, saying Cadence admitted that “employees of its Chinese subsidiary knowingly transferred sensitive U.S. technology to entities that develop supercomputers in support of China’s military modernization and nuclear weapons programs.”

Cadence did not immediately respond to AP requests.

Tan previously launched the venture capital firm Walden International in 1987 to focus on funding tech start-ups, including chip makers. China’s state media has described Tan as “actively” devoted to Chinese and Asian markets, having invested not only in the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company but also China’s state-owned enterprise SMIC, which seeks to advance China’s chipmaking capabilities.

The demands made by Trump and Cotton come as economic and political rivalries between the U.S. and China increasingly focus on the competition over chips, AI and other digital technologies that experts say will shape future economies and military conflicts.

Cotton, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has raised concerns that Chinese spies could be working at tech companies and defense contractors, using their positions to steal secrets or plant digital backdoors that give China access to classified systems and networks.

On Thursday the Arkansas Republican wrote to the Department of Defense urging Defense Secrectary Pete Hegseth to ban all non-U.S. citizens from jobs allowing them to access DoD networks. He has also demanded an investigation into Chinese citizens working for defense contractors.

“The U.S. government recognizes that China’s cyber capabilities pose one of the most aggressive and dangerous threats to the United States, as evidenced by infiltration of our critical infrastructure, telecommunications networks, and supply chains,” Cotton wrote in an earlier letter calling on the Pentagon to conduct the investigation.

National security officials have linked China’s government to hacking campaigns targeting prominent Americans and critical U.S. systems.

“U.S. companies who receive government grants should be responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars and adhere to strict security regulations,” Cotton wrote on the social platform X.

Intel had been a beneficiary of the Biden administration’s CHIPS Act, receiving more than $8 billion in federal funding to build computer chip plants around the country.

Shares of the California company slid 3.5%, while markets, particularly the tech-heavy Nasdaq, gained ground.

Founded in 1968 at the start of the PC revolution, Intel missed the technological shift to mobile computing triggered by Apple’s 2007 release of the iPhone, and it’s lagged more nimble chipmakers. Intel’s troubles have been magnified since the advent of artificial intelligence — a booming field where the chips made by once-smaller rival Nvidia have become tech’s hottest commodity.

Intel is shedding thousands of workers and cutting expenses — including some domestic semiconductor manufacturing capabilities — as Tan tries to revive the fortunes of the struggling chipmaker.",Associated Press,https://apnews.com/article/intel-trump-cotton-yeary-tan-206152398b39bf92ebe6391add109388,"['Michelle Chapman', 'David Klepper', 'and Didi Tang']",Manual
Taiwan Exceeds Full-Year Record for Trade Surplus With US,,"<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0//EN"" ""http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/strict.dtd"">

<span>Taiwan’s trade surplus with the US exceeded its full-year record in just seven months, as a global boom in artificial intelligence fuels demand for its tech products.</span><br><br>
<span>US-bound shipments from Taiwan rose nearly 63% in July from a year earlier to $18.6 billion, the Ministry of Finance said in a statement Friday. That brought the island’s trade surplus with the world’s largest economy to almost $70 billion for January–July, already surpassing the yearly record set in 2024.</span><br><br>
<a name=""footer-start""></a><span>T</span><span>he latest reading showed no sign of a slowdown, with overall exports soaring 42% in July from a year earlier, the biggest gain in 15 years and far more than forecast by any economist in a Bloomberg survey.</span><br><br>
<span>Exports benefited from the rapid development of innovative applications in AI, as well as this month’s deadline for US tariffs to take effect, the ministry said in the statement. It expects full-year exports to reach $500 billion for the first time ever.</span><br><br>
<span>The current full-year record for exports was $479 billion set in 2022.</span><br><br>
<span>Taiwan has been cashing in on surging demand for AI around the world, racking up an unprecedented trade surplus with the US that’s drawn President Donald Trump’s ire. Companies in Taiwan, the biggest global manufacturer of the most advanced chips, have rushed to ship tech products to get ahead of Trump’s tariffs.</span><br><br>
<span>The export growth in July was somewhat overstated given the strong appreciation of Taiwan dollar, said Michelle Lam, Greater China economist at Societe Generale SA. “While we do expect some moderation ahead as front-loading activities ease, the strength of AI demand has remained solid.”</span><br><br>
<span>Last week, the US announced a 20% tariff on goods from Taiwan — which the government in Taipei has called temporary but a rate higher than those imposed on regional rivals including Japan and South Korea. The move sparked concerns that it risks undermining the competitiveness of Taiwanese companies.</span><br><br>
<span>But for Taiwan, even more significant are national security reviews known as Section 232 investigations into semiconductor-related products. At stake in the probes led by the US Department of Commerce are goods that account for some 80% of Taiwan’s US-bound exports, which are currently subject to exemptions.</span><br><br>
<a name=""footer-start""></a><span>O</span><span>n Wednesday, Trump said the tariff rate on chips would be set at 100%, but promised there would be no charge “if you’re building in the United States of America.”</span><br><br>
<span>Investors have</span><span> </span><a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-07/taiwan-chip-giant-surges-on-exemption-from-tough-new-trump-tariffs-on-chips""><span>interpreted</span></a><span> the comment as a positive signal for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., the island’s largest firm and the go-to supplier of advanced chips for Apple Inc and Nvidia Corp. TSMC has been actively investing in US production facilities, which could potentially shield it from the steep tariffs.</span><br><br>
<span>“Uncertainty remains to what extent the 100% chip tariff will affect Taiwan’s chip exports,” Lam said. “Firms which have US capacity such as TSMC may be exempted, but how that plays out for firms without capex commitment remain unclear.”</span><br><br>
<span>The Taiwan government expects exports to grow between 17% and 22% year-on-year next month, even as some traditional industries and mid-sized companies may come under pressure from the new 20% tariff, said Beatrice Tsai, Director General of the Ministry’s Department of Statistics, at a briefing Friday. </span><br><br>
<a name=""footer-start""></a><span>S</span><span>he also said the government is likely to raise its forecasts for economic growth, both for the third quarter and the full year of 2025. The updated projections will be released next Friday.</span><br><br></body></html>",Bloomberg,,"['Yian Lee', 'Miaojung Lin']",Manual

<span>&quot;While the perpetrators of this smuggling operation now face federal criminal charges, their operation represents only a drop in the bucket of the full scope of illegal chip diversion to China,&quot; Carson wrote.</span><br><br>
<span>The letter noted that a recent news report said that at least $1 billion worth of Nvidia advanced AI chips were smuggled into China earlier this year (see </span><a href=""https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://exportcompliancedaily.com/reference/2507240020?BC=bc_68960206599a4__;!!KM5jTBEYT0g9TeDPtIM!qOFk7zXFDOCT7mTMPS3le_szQHHARYb4GerRT4pu73_Y4y52M6aWm5QfDrypb0OfUNiR-74JHssZVHOlTNVBCQ35_rSUqJwflHM$""><span>2507240020</span></a><span>). “These chips are critical enablers of AI capabilities with profound national security implications -- including military modernization, surveillance, and cyber operations by adversarial governments.”</span><br><br>
<span>Carson said a hearing should explore whether Nvidia knew about the illegal diversion of its chips to China, what measures Nvidia has taken to monitor black-market activity, and what responsibility U.S. companies have to prevent their chips from being funneled to restricted end users.</span><br><br>
<span>“Congress has a duty to ensure that U.S. companies are not turning a blind eye to violations of our export laws -- or worse, quietly profiting from them,” he wrote. “A public hearing would help clarify the facts, identify regulatory gaps, and signal that national security cannot be compromised for short-term commercial gain.”</span><br><br>
<span>Carson addressed his letter to the chairmen of the Senate Banking Committee, House Foreign Affairs Committee and House Select Committee on China and also included the ranking members of the three panels. The lawmakers had no immediate comment.</span><br><br>
<span>An Nvidia spokesperson downplayed concerns that smuggled chips could end up in AI data centers in China. &quot;Trying to cobble together data centers from smuggled products is a nonstarter, both technically and economically,” the spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement. “Data centers are massive and complex systems, making smuggling extremely difficult and risky, and we do not provide any support or repairs for restricted products. Rather than risk using smuggled products, the market will turn to widely available competitors such as Huawei, undercutting U.S. leadership in China and worldwide.&quot;</span><br><br></body></html>",Export Compliance Daily,,['Marc Selinger'],Manual
