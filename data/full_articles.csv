The move would likely increase the cost of electronics, autos, household appliances and other essential goods.

“We’ll be putting a tariff of approximately 100% on chips and semiconductors,” Trump said in the Oval Office while meeting with Apple CEO Tim Cook. “But if you’re building in the United States of America, there’s no charge.”

This comes after the president placed an additional 25% tariff on India for its purchases of Russian oil, bringing combined tariffs on the country to 50%. The tariffs will go into effect in 21 days, meaning that both India and Russia might have time to negotiate with the administration on the import taxes.",Associated Press,https://apnews.com/live/donald-trump-news-updates-8-6-2025,[''],chip location tracking
