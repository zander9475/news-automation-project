<p style="" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"">&quot;We're going to be announcing on semiconductors and chips, which is a separate category, because we want them made in the United States,&quot; Trump said during a <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/05/president-donald-trump-to-join-squawk-box-at-8-am-et.html""><span style="" text-decoration: underline; color:#99ebff;"">lengthy interview</span></a> on CNBC's &quot;<a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-box-us/""><span style="" text-decoration: underline; color:#99ebff;"">Squawk Box</span></a>.&quot;</p>
<p style="" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"">Trump said that that announcement will come &quot;within the next week or so.&quot; He did not provide other details about the plan.</p>
<p style="" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"">Global demand for semiconductors and microchips has skyrocketed as the technology has become integrated in virtually all sectors of the economy, including the booming artificial intelligence industry.</p>
<p style="" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"">The vast majority of the world's most advanced semiconductors come from Taiwan, home of <a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/16/2-charts-show-how-much-the-world-depends-on-taiwan-for-semiconductors.html""><span style="" text-decoration: underline; color:#99ebff;"">major chipmaker</span></a> <a href=""/quotes/2330-TW/""><span style="" text-decoration: underline; color:#99ebff;"">TSMC</span></a>, whose customers include <a href=""/quotes/AAPL/""><span style="" text-decoration: underline; color:#99ebff;"">Apple</span></a>, <a href=""/quotes/NVDA/""><span style="" text-decoration: underline; color:#99ebff;"">Nvidia</span></a>, <a href=""/quotes/QCOM/""><span style="" text-decoration: underline; color:#99ebff;"">Qaulcomm</span></a> and <a href=""/quotes/AMD/""><span style="" text-decoration: underline; color:#99ebff;"">AMD</span></a>.</p>
<p style="" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"">Trump revealed the tariff timeline days after he signed an executive order to impose new U.S. duties on a slew of countries' imports, with some trading partners facing steep hikes. Taiwanese goods are set to face an updated tariff of 20% starting this week — though that is down from the 32% duty Trump had previously threatened as part of his April 2 &quot;liberation day&quot; levies.</p>
<p style="" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"">Trump's remarks on CNBC on Tuesday morning emphasized that his tariff plans are far from finished.</p>
<p style="" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"">He said in the same appearance that tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals could eventually reach up to 250%. He had previously said that those tariffs would top out at 200%.</p>
