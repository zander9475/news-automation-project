U.S. Charges Two Chinese Nationals for Illegally Shipping Nvidia AI Chips to China,,"Two Chinese nationals in California have been arrested and charged with the illegal shipment of tens of millions of dollars' worth of AI chips, including those made by Nvidia , the Department of Justice said Tuesday.

Chuan Geng, 28, and Shiwei Yang, 28, exported the sensitive chips and other technology to China from October 2022 through July 2025 without obtaining the required licenses, the DOJ said.

The illicit shipments included Nvidia's H100 general processing units, according to a criminal complaint provided to CNBC. The H100 is among the U.S. chipmaker's most cutting-edge chips used in artificial intelligence applications.

The Department of Commerce has placed such chips under export controls since 2022 as part of broader efforts by the U.S. to restrict China's access to the most advanced semiconductor technology.

This case demonstrates that smuggling is a ""nonstarter,"" Nvidia told CNBC. ""We primarily sell our products to well-known partners, including OEMs, who help us ensure that all sales comply with U.S. export control rules.""

""Even relatively small exporters and shipments are subject to thorough review and scrutiny, and any diverted products would have no service, support, or updates,"" the chipmaker added.

Geng and Yang's California-based company, ALX Solutions, had been founded shortly after the U.S. chip controls first came into place.

According to the DOJ, law enforcement searched ALX Solutions' office and seized phones belonging to Geng and Yang, which revealed incriminating communications between the defendants, including those about evading U.S. export laws by shipping sensitive chips to China through Malaysia.

The review also showed that in December 2024, ALX Solutions made over 20 shipments from the U.S. to shipping and freight-forwarding companies in Singapore and Malaysia, which the DOJ said are commonly used as transshipment points to conceal illicit shipments to China.

Meanwhile, the department said that ALX Solutions was not paid by entities they purportedly exported goods to, instead receiving numerous payments from companies based in Hong Kong and China.

The U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security and the FBI are continuing to investigate the matter.

Geng and Yang have been charged with violating the Export Control Reform Act, a felony that carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in federal prison. Yang was also found to be residing in the U.S. illegally after overstaying her visa.

The smuggling of advanced microchips has become a growing concern in Washington. According to a report from the Financial Times last month, at least $1 billion worth of Nvidia's chips entered China after Donald Trump tightened chip export controls earlier this year.

In response to the report, Nvidia had said that data centers built with smuggled chips were a ""losing proposition"" and that it does not support unauthorized products.

In response to pressure from the U.S., Malaysia said last month that it would begin requiring trade permits for advanced AI chips sourced from the U.S.",CNBC,https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/06/two-chinese-nationals-charged-for-illegally-shipping-nvidia-ai-chips-to-china.html,['Dylan Butts'],"""Bureau of Industry and Security"""
"Nvidia Reiterates Its Chips Have No Backdoors, Urges US Against Location Verification",,"Nvidia has published a blog post reiterating that its chips did not have backdoors or kill switches and appealed to U.S. policymakers to forgo such ideas saying it would be a ""gift"" to hackers and hostile actors.

The blog post, which was published on Tuesday in both English and Chinese, comes a week after the Chinese government summoned the U.S. artificial intelligence (AI) chip giant to a meeting saying it was concerned by a U.S. proposal for advanced chips sold abroad to be equipped with tracking and positioning functions.

The White House and both houses of U.S. Congress have proposed the idea of requiring U.S. chip firms to include location verification technology with their chips to prevent them from being diverted to countries where U.S. export laws ban sales. The separate bills and White House recommendation have not become a formal rule, and no technical requirements have been established.

""Embedding backdoors and kill switches into chips would be a gift to hackers and hostile actors. It would undermine global digital infrastructure and fracture trust in U.S. technology,"" Nvidia said. It had said last week its products have no backdoors that would allow remote access or control.

A backdoor refers to a hidden method of bypassing normal authentication or security controls.

Nvidia emphasized that ""there is no such thing as a 'good' secret backdoor - only dangerous vulnerabilities that need to be eliminated.""",Reuters,https://tech.yahoo.com/ai/articles/nvidia-reiterates-chips-no-backdoors-025056445.html,[''],Manual
Allies Viewed as Less Willing to De-Risk From China if US Eases Export Controls,,"U.S. allies, including in Europe, may back away from their plans to de-risk from China if they continue to see the Trump administration use export controls as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations with China, a panelist said during an event this week hosted by the Center for a New American Security. Others said they’re skeptical about the sustainability of the trade deals announced by the U.S. last week, especially those that commit other countries to large purchases of American goods.
Panelists during the event discussed the results of a trade war-game carried out by the think tank, which tried to simulate how foreign governments might respond to future trade conflicts with the U.S. Emily Kilcrease, director of the CNAS Energy, Economics and Security Program, said the war game showed that other countries “froze” on their efforts to de-risk from China if the U.S. also de-prioritized those efforts in pursuit of a trade deal with Beijing.
“No country team really wanted to think seriously about de-risking from China if the U.S. was no longer pushing that effort,” she said. “I do think it's an important question about how much that's going to play out in the real world.”
The Trump administration earlier this year announced plans to relax its China-related controls for shipments of Nvidia’s advanced H20 chips as part of a trade agreement with China (see 2507150013). And although U.S. officials said they still plan to deny China the most advanced U.S. chip technology (see 2508010002), industry officials have questioned whether the move could backfire on the U.S. the next time it tries to convince allies to restrict their advanced technology shipments to China (see 2507160046).
Kilcrease noted that the U.S. has been “showing more willingness to negotiate over things like export controls,” including those related to U.S. national security, which traditionally is “not something we negotiate over.” The Biden administration pushed its allies, including the Japanese and the Dutch, to strengthen controls over sales of advanced chip manufacturing equipment to China.
“If I'm, for example, Japan and the Netherlands, who's been on the receiving end of a lot of U.S. asks on things like export controls over the past couple of years in critical sectors like semiconductors, all of a sudden I'm really questioning what the U.S. strategy is and if there's going to be an ask of those sorts of countries on things like export controls or any sort of de-risking effort,” Kilcrease said. “I do think they have to ask how durable the U.S. position is going to be on these issues.”
Wendy Cutler, vice president of the Asia Society Policy Institute and a former U.S. trade negotiator, said the administration’s China policy appears to still be “a work in progress,” adding that there are “so many conflicting steps being taken.” Along with its easing of export controls, Cutler wondered whether the U.S. has also refrained from announcing a trade deal with Taiwan “in case China pushes back.”
Cutler said the administration likely will try to reach a deal with China in the coming months, and she’s expecting it largely to involve “big purchases by China” and focus less on larger, structural issues, such as U.S. objections to Chinese excess capacity.
“The type of deal we saw during Trump 1.0 that Ambassador [Robert] Lighthizer led, the phase one deal, which was about 50, 60, pages, including not only purchases which everyone focused on, but frankly, a lot of rules-based chapters -- I just don't see the interest in that this time around.”
Cutler also said she thinks trade deals announced by the Trump administration last week are “very fragile.” She noted that some foreign ministers, including from Japan, received pushback for not securing their deal in writing. Japanese opposition party members criticized the government this week, according to the Japan Times, with one official saying: ""This is the Trump administration we’re talking about. If we don’t issue a written document, (the U.S.) will keep stretching the deal while Japan continues getting ripped off. Doesn’t everyone agree?”
Cutler said she understands why details weren't written down. “Because when you try and write down what you agree to … other issues come up, and you realize that maybe you weren't on the same page on certain details,” she said. “I think in these negotiations, there may be a real gap between folks’ understandings of just fundamental provisions of the agreement.”
Kilcrease said these “handshake deals” will ideally transition into solid agreements over time that align closely with the rules-based trading order, such as including binding commitments not to increase tariffs. She said she would “love to see things move in that direction” but questioned whether they will.
“I think it is a real question about the durability of these deals, particularly if there's something that happens with one of these trading partners that is problematic from a broader policy perspective, or if there is something else that the Trump administration doesn't like. Will they jack up the tariffs again?” she said. “I do think that is a real risk.”
Cutler also said she’s unsure whether countries that agreed to buy more U.S. goods will be able to follow through on those commitments. “Governments can buy the fighter jets, but some of this other stuff has got to be purchased by private companies,” she said. “I think those commitments are going to be a work in progress for the next three-and-a-half years as well.”",Export Compliance Daily,,['Ian Cohen'],Manual
"Chinese Nationals Used US Firm to Illegally Export Chip Tech to China, US Says",,"The U.S. last week arrested and accused two Chinese nationals of using a California-based company to illegally export tens of millions of dollars' worth of advanced AI semiconductors to China, including by first transshipping the chips through Malaysia and Singapore.
Chuan Geng, a U.S. resident, and Shiwei Yang, who DOJ said is living in the U.S. illegally after overstaying her visa, were charged with violating the Export Control Reform Act. Both were arrested Aug. 2 and face a maximum 20-year prison sentence, DOJ said Aug. 5.
The agency said the two used their El Monte-based company, ALX Solutions Inc., to “knowingly and willfully” export sensitive graphic processing units from the U.S. to China without a license from the Bureau of Industry and Security. Geng and Yang founded ALX Solutions shortly after BIS began requiring licenses for the chips, DOJ said. It said some of those chips are known as the “most powerful GPU chip on the market” and are used for AI applications in self-driving cars, and medical diagnosis systems, but DOJ didn’t name the manufacturer.
ALX Solutions exported the chips from October 2022 to July 2025, DOJ said. The agency said it reviewed export and business records and found at least 20 of the company’s shipments that involved exports from the U.S. to shipping and freight-forwarding companies in Singapore and Malaysia, which “commonly are used as transshipment points to conceal illegal shipments to China.” DOJ said ALX Solutions never received payments from those companies, but it instead received “numerous payments” from companies based in Hong Kong and China, including a $1 million payment from a China-based company in January 2024.
The agency also pointed to an instance in December 2024 in which ALX Solutions sent a shipment and “falsely labeled that it was sending GPUs subject to federal laws and regulations.” But DOJ said the shipment contained chips that needed a license before being exported to China, and the company never applied for or obtained a license.
U.S. authorities searched ALX Solutions’ office last week and seized phones belonging to Geng and Yang, and those phones “revealed incriminating communications.” That included information “about shipping export-controlled chips to China through Malaysia to evade U.S. export laws,” DOJ said.
DOJ said Geng was released on $250,000 bond, and Yeng’s detention hearing is scheduled for Aug. 12. Arraignment is scheduled for Sept. 11. They haven’t yet entered pleas.",Export Compliance Daily,,['Ian Cohen'],Manual
BIS Sends Rule Revising Firearm Controls for Interagency Review,,"The Bureau of Industry and Security sent a final rule for interagency review that would revise Biden-era regulations that increased restrictions on firearms exports. The rule, sent for review Aug. 4, is expected to reverse some of those restrictions amid lobbying from gun industry advocates (see 2505290012). Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said in June that the Biden-era rule was ""inconsistent with our views"" (see 2506050050).",Export Compliance Daily,,[],Manual
