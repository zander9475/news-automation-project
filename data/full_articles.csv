Trump Tells Schumer to ‘Go to Hell’ as Senate Heads Home After Failed Attempt to Strike Deal on Nominees,,"<html>
<body>
<p>
            Hours after President Donald Trump told Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer to “go to hell” in a Saturday post on <a href=""https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114961522912167613"">social media</a>, the Senate headed into recess without reaching a deal over confirming Trump’s nominees.
    </p>
<p>
            Senate Republican leader John Thune, Schumer and the White House had been engaged in a round of intense talks to <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/29/politics/senate-gop-trump-nominations"">end the standoff</a> so senators could return to their home states, sources briefed on the conversations told CNN.
    </p>
<p>Schumer had requested federal funds be released and that Trump agree not to push another legislative package that would slash federal funding, sources told CNN.</p>
<p>But, on social media, Trump called Schumer’s demands “egregious and unprecedented,” a sign that talks had collapsed.</p>
<p>Trump had wanted the Senate to confirm his nominees even if that meant skipping the August recess, but his post showed he wasn’t interested in agreeing to Democrats’ terms.</p>
<p>“Tell Schumer, who is under tremendous political pressure from within his own party, the Radical Left Lunatics, to GO TO HELL! Do not accept the offer, go home and explain to your constituents what bad people the Democrats are, and what a great job the Republicans are doing, and have done, for our Country. Have a great RECESS,” he wrote.</p>
<p>On the Senate floor Saturday night, Thune asked for unanimous consent for the chamber to vote on a handful of nominations and then break for a month.</p>
<p>Democrats had been slow-walking Trump’s lower-level nominees, forcing Thune to keep the Senate in session this weekend to confirm them. In the minority, Democrats have the power to force Thune to jump over time-consuming hurdles before the chamber can vote.</p>
<p>Schumer made several demands to agree to let a batch of nominations be quickly confirmed by the Senate, according to the sources. The demands included the unfreezing of federal funds for an array of programs, including the National Institutes of Health and foreign aid.</p>
<p>
            The New York Democrat also wanted Trump to agree that he won’t attempt to push through another package to slash federal funding known as “rescissions” — <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/18/politics/house-trump-doge-cuts-bill"">after a $9 billion package </a>to codify some cuts was approved earlier this summer.
    </p>
<p>Schumer said in a news conference Saturday night that Democrats were “serious” about finding a “reasonable path” to allow bipartisan consideration of Trump’s nominations, but that the president wouldn’t agree to the terms.</p>
<p>“In a fit of rage, Trump threw in the towel, sent Republicans home, and was unable to do the basic work of negotiating. Is this the ‘Art of the Deal’?” Schumer said, pointing to a poster printed with Trump’s social media post.</p>
<p>Schumer declined to get into details of the negotiations with the White House and Thune but said that both sides were “getting close on a whole lot of issues, and Donald Trump just pulled the rug out from under people.”</p>
<p>CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.</p>
<p>Thune told reporters that “the asks evolved on both sides quite a bit over time” but that “we never got to a place where we had both sides agreed to lock it in.”</p>
<p>Thune also suggested that Republicans could consider rules changes to speed up the process when they return in September.</p>
<p>“There’s going to be some conversations around how to fix this over the course of the next month, and I think that I would say that’s a distinct possibility,” the South Dakota Republican said.</p>
<p>Schumer, however, warned that “it would be a huge mistake” for Republicans to try to change Senate rules and said the chamber should be focused on passing appropriations bills in a bipartisan way in September.</p>

<p style="" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"">Since China’s <a href=""https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/deepseek-finds-us-export-controls-at-a-new-sputnik-moment""><span style="" text-decoration: underline; color:#99ebff;"">DeepSeek</span></a> launched its breakthrough app, a noisy debate has intensified regarding America’s resolve on export controls. Two recent events provide a clear signal that cuts through the noise.</p>
<p style="" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"">It would be a mistake to assume that export controls are all about a particular item or technology. Not so. US export controls also encompass end-use and end-user provisions. Who gets the item (or technology) and what they will use it for are as important as the technological parameters of the item.</p>
<p style="" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"">Earlier this year, we <a href=""https://www.thinkbrg.com/thinkset/ai-infrastructure-while-some-doors-close-many-more-open/""><span style="" text-decoration: underline; color:#99ebff;"">anticipated</span></a> that US export controls enforcement would increasingly focus on such end-use and end-user catch-all provisions—rather than item-based technological thresholds—and those catch-all provisions’ emphasis on “knowledge” as defined under the US Export Administration Regulations (EAR) would become increasingly important.<br /><br />The full definition of “knowledge” under the EAR sits at the core of the end-use and end-user provisions. “Knowledge” is not simply black-and-white actual knowledge. The full definition of “knowledge” under the EAR includes both actual knowledge as well as “an awareness of a high probability.”</p>
<p style="" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"">Two recent events have underscored the importance of these intertwined and complementary trends—promoting exports of the American AI tech stack on one hand with enhanced export controls enforcement on the other—for legal &amp; compliance teams, executives, and boards of directors.</p>
<p style="" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"">First, on July 23, the White House announced <a href=""https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Americas-AI-Action-Plan.pdf""><span style="" text-decoration: underline; color:#99ebff;"">America’s AI Action Plan</span></a>. Much attention has focused on the first two “pillars” of the artificial intelligence plan: innovation and infrastructure.</p>
<p style="" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"">Equally important, but somewhat overlooked, is pillar three, “Lead in International AI Diplomacy and Security,” which:</p>
<ul style=""margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; -qt-list-indent: 1;"">
<li style="" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"">Recommends enhanced enforcement, in collaboration with the intelligence community, where there is a “high risk” of diversion of “advanced, U.S.-origin AI compute”</li>
<li style="" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"">Emphasizes end-use and end-user controls</li>
<li style="" margin-top:0px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"">Floats the concept of full-stack AI export packages, to be reviewed holistically by the Department of Commerce and others (which portends potential “stack sweeps”)</li></ul>
<p style="" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"">On July 28, the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security <a href=""https://www.bis.gov/press-release/cadence-design-systems-pay-95-million-penalty-bis-unauthorized-exports-chinese-entities-tied-development""><span style="" text-decoration: underline; color:#99ebff;"">announced</span></a> a $95 million penalty on Cadence Design Systems, Inc.—its largest standalone penalty in two years. This was also part of an overall $140 million resolution that also included a criminal guilty plea <a href=""https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/cadence-design-systems-agrees-plead-guilty-and-pay-over-140-million-unlawfully-exporting""><span style="" text-decoration: underline; color:#99ebff;"">agreed</span></a> with the US Department of Justice’s National Security Division. This enforcement action was based on publicly disclosed facts of efforts by multiple entities in China and Cadence’s own China employees to evade US export controls.</p>
<p style="" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"">This is a signal that, consistent with pillar three, the US will continue to use export controls to protect its national security interests, and that preventing exports—either directly or indirectly—to Chinese entities on the Entity List remains a national security priority, regardless of the ebbs and flows of trade negotiations.</p>
<p style="" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"">This was also the first significant corporate enforcement action driven not by actual knowledge by the company involved that an export was prohibited, but by the full definition of “knowledge” under the US export controls, which includes “an awareness of a high probability” that an export is destined for a prohibited recipient as a basis for exporter liability. It follows an Aug. 15, 2024, precursor <a href=""https://www.bis.gov/node/20464""><span style="" text-decoration: underline; color:#99ebff;"">resolution</span></a> emphasizing the same full definition of “knowledge” under the EAR.</p>
<p style="" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"">This renewed emphasis in both policy and enforcement on the catch-all provisions and their reliance on “high probability” awareness represents a profound—and incredibly powerful—shift in export controls enforcement.</p>
<p style="" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"">As we’ve written <a href=""https://www.bloomberglaw.com/bloomberglawnews/us-law-week/XA02FVAG000000?bna_news_filter=us-law-week#jcite""><span style="" text-decoration: underline; color:#99ebff;"">previously</span></a>, the “high probability” standard isn’t unique to US export controls and has become the new national security paradigm for white-collar enforcement. In addition to fueling prior Foreign Corrupt Practice Act enforcement, it was included in the Department of the Treasury’s outbound investment rule and the Department of Commerce’s Information and Communications Technology and Services framework.</p>
<p style="" margin-top:12px; margin-bottom:12px; margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px; -qt-block-indent:0; text-indent:0px;"">The AI Action Plan’s commitment to cutting red tape to promote innovation and infrastructure doesn’t mean getting rid of export controls. Companies accordingly need to re-evaluate their assessments of export control risks to ensure they consider the full definition of “knowledge”—both in fact and in a way that they can demonstrate to boards, to management, and even to BIS and DOJ if necessary.</p>
